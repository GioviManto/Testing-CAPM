# Testing the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) on the FTSEMIB Index: A Six-Year Analysis (2018-2023) ​
The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), introduced by Treynor (1961), Sharpe (1964), Lintner (1965), and Mossin (1966), remains a cornerstone of modern financial theory, elucidating the relationship between risk and expected return. This thesis empirically tests the CAPM using data from the FTSEMIB Index spanning from January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2023. The study estimates beta coefficients for individual stocks within the index, analyzes the relationship between returns and the predictions of the CAPM, and investigate deviations from the model's forecasts. This research contributes to the ongoing debate on the model's validity, particularly in the context of the Italian stock market. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset, the thesis employs various statistical tools to test the CAPM. The findings reveal the extent to which the CAPM holds true in the Italian market, in the specified period, highlighting instances where the model's assumptions and predictions diverge from observed data. Additionally, the study explores the implications of these deviations for investors and management, offering insights into the practical utility of the CAPM. The results indicate that while the CAPM provides a useful framework, its predictive power is not absolute, necessitating caution among investors relying solely on CAPM for investment decisions. The thesis underscores the importance of considering alternative models and factors beyond CAPM to better capture asset pricing dynamics. Future research directions are proposed to further enhance understanding and application of asset pricing models in different market environments. ​
